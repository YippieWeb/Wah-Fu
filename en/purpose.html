                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>The Wah Fu Church of Christ was established in 1968. At that time, a sister from the Wanchai Church of Christ moved into the newly built Wah Fu Estate. 
                    Initially, the church met at her home, but later they applied for rooms 618 and 619 in Wah Kee House for gatherings, and the Wah Fu Church of Christ 
                    gradually began to form.
                </p><br>
                <p>The Wah Fu Church of Christ is a Church of Christ. In 1925, American George S. Benson came to Hong Kong to evangelize and organized the Church of Christ. 
                    Early missionary work was carried out by American missionaries, including E.L. Broaddus and Elizabeth Bernard.  Elizabeth Bernard spent the most of her 
                    life in Hong Kong and passed away here. The missionaries also founded the Canton Bible School in Guangzhou to train local ministers. Unfortunately, due 
                    to the turmoil of war, these works have disappeared.
                </p><br> 
                <p>The Churches of Christ currently existing in Hong Kong were established after the war by American missionaries who also operated Bible college to train local 
                    ministers. Currently, there are four Churches of Christ in Hong Kong, located in Wah Fu, Wan Chai, Mong Kok, and Yuen Long. Each church is completely 
                    independent but maintains regular contact with each other.
